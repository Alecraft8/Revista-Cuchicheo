This is a small project started in March 2023, with the purpose of promoting innovation and technology in a school located in Mariara, Carabobo (Venezuela). 

It is a web page that simulates being a digital magazine and contains: title, navigation bar, editorial, calendar and much more.

Updates will be coming soon as the months go by, stay tuned on my web server: cuchicheo.atwebpages.com
